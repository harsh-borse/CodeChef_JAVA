Chef's coding journey continues.
Chef was given an integer input $N$.

He wrote a code using WHILE loops to output the factorial of N.
But he wasn't able to complete some parts of the code.

	{
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N, factorial = 1;   
        N = scanner.nextInt();  

        int i = 1;
        while (i <= N) {        
            factorial = factorial * i;     
            i++;
        }
