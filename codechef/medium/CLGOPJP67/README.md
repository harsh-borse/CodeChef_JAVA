## Problem

### Find the Area of any rectangle

Let us revisit our favourite rectangle and its area problem.

Write a program which does the following:

- Declare 2 integer variables length and width.
- In this problem - accept 2 user defined inputs from the console and initialise these values length and width.
- Create another integer variable area - compute the area of the rectangle and store it as area.
- Output area to the console.
### Sample 1:
Input

```
